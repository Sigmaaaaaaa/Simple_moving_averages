# Simple_moving_averages
Simple Moving Average smooths out price data by calculating the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, over a specific period. It helps identify trends and potential buy/sell signals.
Applications
- Trend detection
- Entry/exit signals
- Smoothing noisy data
- Backtesting strategies

- Use longer windows (e.g., 50 period, 200 period) for trend confirmation
- Combine with other indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for better accuracy
- Avoid using SMA alone for high-frequency trading
